TODO
  Finish scheduling code 
    . play and pause don't seem to be getting called at time - not even
      console.log outputs anything
  Change current play and pause route functions so that they use
    new play/pause functions
  Start/stop playback at certain time (single time for now!)
  Overall design of interface
       
  Need to have "refresh token" code execute if auth to spotify doesn't work
  Figure out a way to get Librespot device to show up in device list automatically; otherwise
   I have to run librespot manually (with login credentials)
   . might be easier to do with shell script rather than w/in node.js



FEATURES TO ADD
  Button(s) to choose assembly or regular schedule
  
  Keep track of songs played in playlist and don't play them again until
    playlist is exhausted (maybe easiest way to do this is to download
    playlist once, randomize list, and just loop through the list; would
    need to handle situation where playlist is updated with new songs)
    . or perhaps just a "if this song has been played in the last x songs,
      skip to next, if that song has been played in the last x songs..."
  


MAYBE
  Some kind of indicator that shows it's connected to spotify?
