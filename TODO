TODO


  Bug, possibly with librespot, where device not found after a long
    period of time
  . error: getaddrerror EAI_AGAIN 
  . MAYBE fixed - need to do all-day test

  Overall design of interface
  Security - have pi go to lock screen
  . make sure everything still works when locked

      



FEATURES TO ADD
  
  Keep track of songs played in playlist and don't play them again until
    playlist is exhausted (maybe easiest way to do this is to download
    playlist once, randomize list, and just loop through the list; would
    need to handle situation where playlist is updated with new songs)
    . or perhaps just a "if this song has been played in the last x songs,
      skip to next, if that song has been played in the last x songs..."
  


MAYBE
  Some kind of indicator that shows it's connected to spotify?
  Need to have "refresh token" code execute if auth to spotify doesn't work
  . skipping this for now - just having page reload every 50 minutes
    which reauthorizes it
    Have auth to Spotify run before main page even loads, that way
    you don't need to load main page to have it work! (may not be possible since user may have to login to Spotify)
