TODO

  Set Pi to have static IP during development so I can test on PC
  . or hope that I get the same IP (.134) for now and deal with this when I don't.
  Add code to change to librespot device
  Start/stop playback at certain time (single time for now!)
  Overall design of interface
       
  Need to have "refresh token" code execute if auth to spotify doesn't work
  Don't forget to keep committing to git!
  Figure out a way to get Librespot device to show up in device list automatically; otherwise
   I'd have to stream from my phone every time to get it to show up in device
   list



FEATURES
  Button(s) to choose assembly or regular schedule
  


MAYBE
  Some kind of indicator that shows it's connected to spotify?
